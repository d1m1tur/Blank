Blank is an isometric game i am working on in the moment but i dont have original art and all i have done is the 
map creator and some basic character movement. I have an idea for an original and interesting main story, which 
i am not including in this since it contains spoilers.

Tree Hack is a desktop game made by me for a hackaton (HackTUES) so the code is not very good and has a couple of bugs, 
it has an android version and a web site made by the other members of the team.

TowerDefense is a game i was developing by i kind of gave up on that ...

Frustration is another game made for a hackaton (SofiaGameJam) ... its made using Unity and
the project is not included. It is a first person game with a main theme "What do i do now".


As you can see i like C++ and i write games using SDL

... Sorry for the bad english i am from Bulgaria.
